This is useful for iterating over multiple lists using one for loop, thus reducing the time it takes to process multiple lists. I knew you could slice lists, but I hadn't thought about using slicing to simple reorder parts of a list. It makes it easy to move a part of a list in the order without going element by element. Finally, I learned the built in python function for sorting lists, which uses a really efficient combination of sorting algorithms depending on the size of the input. While the worst case scenario is still O(n log n) it's more consistantly faster than that in it's average case.
